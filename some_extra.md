After bounty he tried One param everywhere but changing requests like changing GET to POST and POST to GET and just like that PUT to POST and GET, not just that let's play around with Content-Type and change the content type as application/JSON to application/x-www-form-urlencoded vice versa.

All of them are disclosing Password

## > Github Creds to [login in Tesla](https://medium.com/heck-the-packet/how-i-got-my-first-big-bounty-payout-with-tesla-8d28b520162d)

He did recon found nothing used "tesla.com" pwd= 

found base64 encoded creds . He used those creds to login but MFA made it not possible . used the ServiceNow API . No MFA in api 

```
ServiceNow installations. While it is a cloud service, it often includes the use of something they call a “MID Server” which is responsible for pushing information into your cloud instance. This information includes Active Directory data (Users, computers etc.). This is how ServiceNow is able to link an Incident or a Helpdesk Ticket to a particular user. This is also how it allows engineers to plan maintenance on production systems as they’re also imported and managed within ServiceNow’s Configuration Item DB.
```

```
What this means is that in this instance, by querying the right table (and having the right access), someone could effectively build a map of all internal servers, their internal IP addresses, specs and descriptions.

as per RFC the maximum length allowed for an email address is 255 characters. However, we don't validate email length, so you can add email addresses that exceed 255 characters. Through this, if you sign up for an email with a length of 1 million or more and log in, withdraw, or change your email, the server may cause DOS due to overload.
